# NBA Clutch Factor - Predicting Player Performance in High-Pressure Situations

## Project Overview

This machine learning system predicts NBA player performance during clutch time situations (final 5 minutes of games with â‰¤5 point differential). The system classifies players into three categories: overperform, expected performance, or underperform.

## Features

- Processes NBA play-by-play data from 2015-2021
- Engineered 15+ clutch-specific performance features
- Implements Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression models
- Interactive dashboard for real-time predictions
- Achieves 74%+ accuracy in performance classification

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn & XGBoost** - Machine Learning
- **Streamlit** - Web dashboard
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Visualizations
